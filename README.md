Hey, <br>
This is my **First Project** using Laravel.


## This Blog

<br>

I have used [Verta](https://hekmatinasser.github.io/verta/) package for *dates*

<br>

## To run project on you system :

1. you can paste it in localhost and open `public/index.php` (not recommended) <br>
2. you can use this cmd in project's terminal `php artisan serve` (you'd better have composer installed on your device) and go to this link in your browser: `127.0.0.1:8000/` <br>

## v1.0 :

<br>

Can see articles, their comments, Register-Login and logout. <br>
This version has no exciting appearance. <br>
You can't choose your article image yet. <br>
