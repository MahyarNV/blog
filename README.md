Hey, <br>
This is my **First Project** using Laravel.


## This Blog

<br>

I have used [Verta](https://hekmatinasser.github.io/verta/) package for *dates*

<br>

## To run project on your system :

1. you can paste it in localhost and open `public/index.php` (not recommended) <br>
2. you can use this cmd in project's terminal `php artisan serve` (you'd better have composer installed on your device) and go to this link in your browser: `127.0.0.1:8000/` <br>
 For any ways, you'd better connect to internet because of article photos (with [lorem Pixel](https://lorempixel.com))
 You have to make a database in your localhost (for both ways to run) that names `blog`.
 For making tables you have to use this cmd : `php artisan migrate`
 Then if you want to have fake datas in project, You can use this cmd : `php artisan db:seed`
